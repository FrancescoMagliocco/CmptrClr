# Info on the `scala` syntax files
- I have no idea what the following is:
  - `scalaBlock` - Actually I think I may have an idea
  - `scalaCapitalWord`
  - `scalaInstanceDeclaration`
  - `scalaTypeAnnotation` - When first making this syntax file, I think I had
      some isues, but were resolved after reloading **vim**.  So I will have to
      come back to this and check everything out.
- `scalaSpecial` was first linked to `preProc`..
- I also believe that `scalaSquaredBracketBracket` was first linked to
    `preProc`.  I'm not sure..  I'm also not 100% sure as to what this may be
    for, but I think I have a general idea.

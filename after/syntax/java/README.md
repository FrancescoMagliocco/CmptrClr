# Info on the `java` syntax files
- `javaAnnotation` is linked to `preProc` by default which does make sense, but
    it also kind of makes sense to link to `special`..  For now lets just keep
    it linked to `preProc`.
- `javaBranch` highlights the word `break;` which is used in `switch` machines.
    (Is that what they are technically called?)
- `javaScopeDecl` is for word like `private`, `public` etc..  Make sure this
    matches the same for other languages.
